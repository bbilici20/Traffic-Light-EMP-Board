# Traffic-Light-EMP-Board
This is my solution to how to program an EMP board to act like a traffic light. The traffic light has three modes: normal mode, Norwegian night mode and emergency mode. The model is implemented as a state machine.
The project is implemented on Tiva-c series microcontroller kit with RISC ARM architecture.
